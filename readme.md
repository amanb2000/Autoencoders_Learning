# Learning About Autoencoders
## Goals
The main goals of this project was to learn more about the implementation of autoencoders
and to effectively compress images of landscapes from the [MIT CSAIL Places](http://places.csail.mit.edu) dataset.

However, due to the massive size of this dataset (over 1500 gb), I decided to switch to using a [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/jessicali9530/celeba-dataset)
